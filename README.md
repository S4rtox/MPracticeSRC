# What is this?
Old java plugin I made for minecraft using Spigot API. Being a [SkyWars](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/SkyWars) like mode. Didn't really finish it fully. But keeping it here as a reminder that I actually used to do some stuff, and for portafolio.
# Is it useful?
Probably not, as I wasn't the best at coding at the time, and was still learning code structuring and java in general. (Also didnt fully grasp maven, or git in general)
